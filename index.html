          Happy Valley Shelter has been finding safe and loving homes for dogs
          in the Piedmont area since 1989. We work in cooperation with local
          county shelters and rescue organizations and specialize in caring for
          neglected and abandoned dogs.
        </p>
        <p class="homepara">
          At Happy Valley, our staff are trained in all aspects of animal
          welfare and can give you expert advice on adoption, training, and
          care. We are proud of the work we do at Happy Valley and are grateful
          to our community for their support in helping us achieve our mission.
        </p>
        <p class="homepara">
          We take great care in matching each dog with the right family to
          ensure a successful adoption. We believe that every dog deserves a
          loving home, and we work tirelessly to make that a reality.
